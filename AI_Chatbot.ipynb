        "In this project, I developed an intelligent chatbot utilizing generative AI techniques, API key integration, and natural language processing modules to create a responsive, context-aware conversational agent. The chatbot is powered by a generative language model, which enables it to understand user queries and generate human-like responses. The API key integration allows the chatbot to securely interact with external data sources and AI platforms, expanding its capability to retrieve real-time information, execute dynamic actions, and improve overall conversation quality.\n",
